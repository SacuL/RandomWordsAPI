## Get Random Words

Request: /w?n=3

Response: ["music","butter","brook"]

## Why

Well, this is not some production ready high performance API. I build it because I needed some random words for a fun project and could not find a simple API avaible. So here you go, free for everyone to use or host it yourself.

## Words source

Currently using all 5459 words from "google-10000-english-usa-no-swears-medium" list from https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english
